This is an experimental repository exploring using the <a
href="https://developers.google.com/blockly">blockly library</a> as an
interface for constructing tactic proofs in Lean for pedagogical purposes.

It is derived from <a
href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4web">Lean4Web</a>
and currently has content from Alex Kontorovich's <a
href="https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/RealAnalysisGame/">Real
Analysis course</a>.
